## Die Hard with a Portfolio

Detective Portfolio McClane (Bcrypt Willis) is now divorced, undefined and class-less after getting suspended for his reckless use of js and bad non-dry code. He is called back into action, however, when a cryptic terrorist (JSON Irons) takes ðŸ—½New York CityðŸ—½ hostage in a lethal game of "Submit Your Portfolio" and refuses to speak with anyone but McClane. Teaming up with a street-SQL database named Jest Carver (Samuel L. JQuery), McClane dashes through VS Code, trying to stay one step ahead of a murderous DROP DATABASE script.

With additional projects completed it was time to update and improve the portfolio. You will find a more responsive and better laid out portfolio that is more user friendly and has more features than before. 

Unlikely team-ups make for success in projects just like the did in the seach for Hans Gruber's brother! You may even ask yourself, "3 Portfolios ago he was just a regular cop in an extreme situation and now he is spitting out projects for portfolios like a super hero. How is this possible?"
